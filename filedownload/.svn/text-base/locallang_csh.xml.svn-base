You can add multiple files to the field as desired. If you are uploading files, is best to give them a unique name for clear identification: 2011-01-03_file.pdf is preferable to file.pdf. If you upload a file that has the same filename as a previously uploaded file, TYPO3 will append a number following the file name. Your second file.pdf file would display as file_01.pdf</label>
